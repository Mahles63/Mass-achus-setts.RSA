[Brief Introduction]

Cybersecurity Portfolio üõ°Ô∏è 


As a Junior Technical Engineer with a strong foundation in secure application development and cloud infrastructure, I bring a proactive and detail-oriented approach to cybersecurity. My expertise spans ethical hacking, IAM configuration across AWS and Azure, and front-end security design. I‚Äôve completed EC-Council cybersecurity workshops, gaining exposure to threat modeling, secure coding, and incident response aligned with CEH methodologies.

In parallel, I am advancing my specialization through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera, where I‚Äôve completed the first four modules with distinction:
‚Ä¢ 	Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity
Developed a strategic understanding of the threat landscape, core principles like the CIA Triad, and the roles of ethical hackers in modern security ecosystems.

‚Ä¢ 	Module 2: Key Cybersecurity Terms and Concepts
Mastered foundational terminology including malware, phishing, DDoS, and zero-day exploits. Applied concepts such as risk, vulnerability, and mitigation in real-world scenarios.

‚Ä¢ 	Module 3: Security Frameworks and Controls
Gained working knowledge of NIST, ISO/IEC 27001, CIS Controls, and MITRE ATT&CK. Practiced aligning security controls with compliance standards and layered defense strategies.

‚Ä¢ 	Module 4: Introduction to Python, SQL, and Linux
Built hands-on skills in Python scripting for log parsing and automation, SQL for anomaly detection, and Linux CLI for system auditing and basic hardening.
These modules complement my existing certifications (CompTIA A+, Azure DP-900) and my practical experience at Matlala Group, where I‚Äôve been nominated for the cloud developer stream. I continue to integrate cybersecurity principles into cloud architecture, secure coding workflows, and UI/UX design, with a focus on scalable, threat-resilient systems.
üöÄ Goals
- Complete the full certificate with distinction
- Build a cybersecurity portfolio for career advancement
- Integrate learnings into cloud development and secure architecture at Matlala Group

  
Why This Repository Matters
This repository is more than a study log‚Äîit's a reflection of my commitment to mastering cybersecurity through structured learning, hands-on practice, and real-world application. As I progress through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I aim to:
‚Ä¢ 	Build a portfolio that demonstrates technical depth and strategic thinking
‚Ä¢ 	Integrate cybersecurity principles into cloud development and secure architecture
‚Ä¢ 	Prepare for advanced certifications and roles in cloud security, threat intelligence, and automation
‚Ä¢ 	Share insights and tools with others pursuing similar paths in tech and security
Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow learner, I invite you to explore, connect, and grow with me.
